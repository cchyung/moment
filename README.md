# Moment
Photo discovery platform driven by AI

A Project for HackSC 2019

## Description
Moment lets you navigate through your photo library through similar photos and generates tags that let you easily search through your library.

### How it Works
1. Users may upload images by dragging them into the application
2. Images are passed through two separate deep learning models which provide tag data as well as feature vectors
3. Images are indexed into Elasticsearch which allows filter by tag and vector similarity search using cosine distance
4. You can explore your photo library through visually similar images, search and browse through intelligent albums using tags generated by the model

### Technologies
Moment is powered by the following technologies:
 - Google Cloud (AI Platform, Vision API, Google Cloud Storage, Kubernetes)
 - XCeption Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
 - Elastic Search
 - Flask (Backend Server)
 - Isotope.js (Tiling for frontend)
 - Dropzone.js (For easy file upload)
